Let me explain the employment deduction for salaried individuals in Bangladesh:

## What is Employment Deduction?

Employment deduction is a tax benefit that allows salaried employees to reduce their taxable income by a certain amount before calculating their income tax liability. This deduction recognizes the various work-related expenses that employees incur.

## How the Deduction Works

The employment deduction is calculated as **1/3 of "income from employment" or a maximum cap, whichever is lower**. Previously, this maximum cap was BDT 450,000, but it has now been increased to BDT 500,000.

## Calculation Formula

**Employment Deduction = Minimum of:**
1. 1/3 of your total salary income, OR
2. BDT 500,000 (the new maximum limit)

## Examples

**Example 1: Lower Salary**
- Annual Salary: BDT 900,000
- 1/3 of salary = BDT 300,000
- Since BDT 300,000 < BDT 500,000, deduction = **BDT 300,000**

**Example 2: Higher Salary**
- Annual Salary: BDT 2,000,000
- 1/3 of salary = BDT 666,667
- Since BDT 666,667 > BDT 500,000, deduction = **BDT 500,000** (capped)

## Impact of the Increase

The increase from BDT 450,000 to BDT 500,000 means:

- **Tax Savings**: Salaried individuals with higher incomes can now deduct an additional BDT 50,000 from their taxable income
- **Beneficiaries**: This particularly benefits employees earning BDT 1,500,000 or more annually (since 1/3 of BDT 1,500,000 = BDT 500,000)
- **Tax Reduction**: The additional BDT 50,000 deduction could save between BDT 2,500 to BDT 15,000 in taxes, depending on your tax bracket

## Who Can Claim This?

This deduction is specifically for **salaried employees** - those who receive "income from employment" such as:
- Basic salary
- Allowances
- Bonuses
- Other employment benefits

## Other Employment-Related Benefits

The government has also introduced additional benefits for salaried individuals:

- **Free Transport Facility**: Changes to how notional income from free transport is calculated
- **Group Insurance**: Group insurance premiums paid by employers won't be treated as taxable income
- **Critical Illness**: Payments for major medical procedures (brain surgery, heart surgery, cancer treatment, etc.) won't be considered taxable salary income

This employment deduction helps reduce the tax burden on salaried individuals and acknowledges the various costs associated with employment.
